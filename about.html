    <h2>About BlockVerse</h2>
    <pre>BlockVerse is a simple gaming website created as part of my SNW Capstone Project. 

    It showcases some of the most popular and trending games in the world.  

    The design is inspired by Minecraft’s dark and creative theme.</pre>
    <br></br>

    <pre>This project is built using basic web technologies — 
        
        HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

    It helped me understand how real websites are created step-by-step.</pre>
